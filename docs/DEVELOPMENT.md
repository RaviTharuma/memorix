# Development Guide

This guide is for contributors working on Memorix itself.

Memorix is a TypeScript project built around:

- MCP server runtime
- memcode bundled terminal-agent runtime
- CLI workflows
- SQLite canonical persistence with compatibility/fallback layers
- Orama search
- dashboard and HTTP service

## Current Development Baseline

The current release work targets the **1.4 line** while package metadata may still show the last published version until the release commit is cut.

Contributors should assume the following areas are part of the 1.4 release line:

- shared memory across MCP clients, CLI, SDK, dashboard, hooks, and memcode
- memcode uses Memorix project memory, hooks, `/memory` commands, resumable sessions, and model switching as the bundled terminal agent
- TOML-first configuration with global `~/.memorix/config.toml` and project `<git-root>/memorix.toml`
- separate `[agent]`, `[memory.llm]`, and `[embedding]` model lanes
- privacy-safe handoff receipts and doctor receipt diagnostics
- optional session semantics in generated agent rules
- notify-only auto-update by default with explicit install opt-in
- dashboard config loading aligned with CLI/TUI status surfaces
- the existing layered retrieval, retention, attribution, and compact output model
- source-backed long-term memory with candidate, qualification, approval, archival, supersession, and explicit portable user scope

## 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js `>=22.18.0`
- npm
- Git

Clone and install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AVIDS2/memorix.git
cd memorix
npm install
```

Optional local dependencies:

- `fastembed` for local embedding experiments
- `@huggingface/transformers` for transformer embedding mode

Memorix still works without them.

## 2. Core Commands

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Watch mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Typecheck

```bash
npm run lint
```

`lint` currently runs `tsc --noEmit`.

### Full test suite

```bash
npm test
```

### Vitest watch mode

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

### Local runtime checks

```bash
memorix serve
memorix background start
memorix status
```

## 3. Recommended Development Loop

For most feature work:

1. write or update a focused test
2. implement the change
3. run the targeted test file
4. run `npm run lint`
5. run `npm run build`
6. run `npm test`
7. validate the real MCP or CLI path if the feature affects runtime behavior

Examples:

```bash
npx vitest run tests/git/noise-filter.test.ts
npm run lint
npm run build
npm test
```

If the feature touches the dashboard, HTTP transport, or MCP wiring, do a live verification after the test suite.

Docs layout:

- `README.md`: landing page and quick start
- `docs/SETUP.md`: client setup and troubleshooting
- `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`: TOML-first config and legacy compatibility
- `docs/MEMCODE.md`: bundled terminal-agent guide
- `docs/GIT_MEMORY.md`: Git Memory workflows
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: system design
- `docs/API_REFERENCE.md`: MCP tool surface

## 5. Runtime Modes to Validate

### stdio MCP

```bash
memorix serve
```

Use this to validate:

- tool registration
- stdio MCP behavior
- IDE integration compatibility

### HTTP MCP + dashboard

```bash
memorix background start
```

Use this to validate:

- HTTP MCP endpoint
- Team tools
- dashboard API parity
- dashboard UX

Use `memorix serve-http --port 3211` when you want the same stack in the foreground for debugging, manual supervision, or custom ports.

### Dashboard-only mode

```bash
memorix dashboard
```

Useful for local UI checks. The HTTP service also serves the embedded dashboard used in normal background mode.

## 6. Feature Areas Worth Testing Live

Some features deserve real runtime verification, not just tests:

- project identity detection
- config provenance
- Git hook installation and post-commit ingest
- cross-project search and detail refs
- HTTP transport and Team tools
- dashboard graph stability and page layout

When validating these, prefer:

- real MCP calls
- real CLI commands
- real temporary Git repositories

over only unit tests.

---

## 7. Git Memory Development Notes

Git Memory turns commit history into searchable engineering memory, so changes here directly affect how well agents can recall what changed in a codebase.

When working in this area, validate:

- `memorix git-hook --force`
- `memorix git-hook-uninstall`
- `memorix ingest commit`
- `memorix ingest commit --force`
- `memorix ingest log --count N`

Also validate behavior in:

- normal repositories
- worktrees
- noisy commit streams

See [GIT_MEMORY.md](GIT_MEMORY.md) for user-facing behavior.

---

## 8. Configuration Development Notes

Memorix uses TOML as the primary user-facing config model:

- global `~/.memorix/config.toml`
- project `<git-root>/memorix.toml`

When touching config code, always validate:

- project `memorix.toml`
- global `~/.memorix/config.toml`
- project `.env`
- user `~/.memorix/.env`
- legacy project/user `memorix.yml`
- legacy `~/.memorix/config.json`
- env var overrides

And always check:

```bash
memorix status
```

to make sure provenance diagnostics match runtime behavior.

---

## 9. Release Workflow

The repository's canonical workflow is [Memorix release](knowledge/workflows/memorix-release.md).
It is the versioned source for agents and maintainers; its checks supplement,
rather than replace, the explicit maintainer approval required to publish.

Recommended release flow:

1. update docs and version metadata
2. run:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
npm test
```

Model catalog refresh is a separate maintenance step, not part of the release
build. Run it only when intentionally updating generated provider snapshots:

```bash
npm run update-models
git diff -- packages/ai/src/models.generated.ts packages/ai/src/image-models.generated.ts
```

The generators refuse unexpectedly shrunken live results by default. If a shrink
is intentional after reviewing the diff, rerun with
`MEMORIX_ALLOW_MODEL_CATALOG_SHRINK=1`.

3. validate key live flows:

- MCP store/search/detail
- dashboard
- Git Memory
- config diagnostics
- `memorix setup --agent codex --global` followed by `memorix doctor agents --agent codex --scope global --json` in an isolated home, when changing the Codex integration

4. inspect package contents:

```bash
npm pack --dry-run --json
```

5. commit and push
6. publish the supported public package manually when ready:

```bash
npm publish --access public
```

Notes:

- `prepublishOnly` synchronizes and checks Registry metadata, then runs build + test; it does not contact live model catalog APIs
- `server.json` is the official MCP Registry record. Keep it synchronized with
  `package.json` by running `npm run sync:mcp-registry`; verify it with
  `npm run check:mcp-registry` before a release.
- The GitHub publish workflow can publish npm first, then uses GitHub OIDC to
  publish the same verified version to the official MCP Registry. When npm was
  already published manually, run the workflow with `publish_npm=false` to
  publish only the Registry record. It does not require a Registry token or
  private key in repository secrets.
- `@memorix/ai`, `@memorix/agent-core`, `@memorix/tui`, and `@memorix/memcode` are internal workspaces. Their code is bundled into the root `memorix` distribution and they must stay `private` unless the project deliberately establishes an owned npm scope and a separate package-support contract.
- npm publish is usually manual, especially when 2FA is enabled
- GitHub release automation should not be treated as a substitute for manual runtime validation

---

## 10. Contribution Standards

When contributing to Memorix:

- keep public docs aligned with runtime behavior
- prefer explicit, project-safe behavior over clever fallback
- avoid adding features without a clear product story
- validate MCP behavior with real calls when changing server logic
- keep Git Memory, reasoning memory, and retrieval semantics coherent

Memorix is strongest when its engineering truth layer, reasoning layer, and local service runtime all stay in sync.
