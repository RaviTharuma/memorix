# Memorix Configuration Guide

Memorix uses TOML as its main configuration model:

- global defaults: `~/.memorix/config.toml`
- project overrides: `<git-root>/memorix.toml`

The project file is loaded only after Memorix has resolved the real project root
from `.git`. Config files do not decide project identity.

Legacy `memorix.yml`, `.env`, and `~/.memorix/config.json` files are still read
for compatibility, but new setup flows and docs use TOML.

---

## Minimal Example

Run:

```bash
memorix init
```

The init wizard lets you choose:

- `Global defaults` for personal multi-project workflows
- `Project config` for repo-specific overrides

Example `~/.memorix/config.toml`:

```toml
[agent]
provider = "deepseek"
model = "deepseek-chat"
base_url = "https://api.deepseek.com/v1"
api_key = "..."

[memory.llm]
provider = "openai"
model = "qwen3.5-flash"
base_url = "https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1"
api_key = "..."

[embedding]
provider = "api"
model = "text-embedding-v4"
base_url = "https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1"
api_key = "..."

[rerank]
provider = "http"
model = "jina-reranker-v3"
# base_url and api_key inherit [memory.llm] when unset.
# Point base_url at OmniRoute /v1 — never api.jina.ai.

[memory]
inject = "minimal"
formation = "active"
auto_cleanup = true
sync_advisory = true

[git]
auto_hook = false
ingest_on_commit = true
max_diff_size = 500
skip_merge_commits = true
exclude_patterns = ["*.lock", "dist/**"]
noise_keywords = ["format", "typo"]

[codegraph]
exclude_patterns = ["vendor/**", "third_party/**", "generated/**"]
max_file_bytes = 2097152

# Optional: use an already-indexed local CodeGraph only when it is healthy.
external_context = "auto"
# external_command = "C:\\tools\\codegraph.cmd"
external_timeout_ms = 1200

[server]
transport = "stdio"
dashboard = true
dashboard_port = 3210
```

Global `config.toml` is local to your machine and is the normal place to keep
provider credentials. Project `memorix.toml` should be treated as repo config:
override models, switches, and behavior there, but do not commit credentials.

---

## Resolution Order

Memorix resolves configuration in this order:

1. explicit CLI flags
2. process environment variables
3. project `<git-root>/memorix.toml`
4. global `~/.memorix/config.toml`
5. legacy compatibility files
6. built-in defaults

Environment variables stay available for CI, MCP launchers, and temporary shell
overrides. They are not the default user-facing setup path.

If you want the simplest setup, configure `~/.memorix/config.toml` once and stop
there. Add `<git-root>/memorix.toml` only when a repository needs different
models, memory behavior, or server defaults.

---

## Configuration Lanes

### `[agent]`

Used by memcode's interactive coding agent.

Common keys:

- `provider`
- `model`
- `base_url`
- `api_key`

This lane follows memcode's agent runtime behavior. `/model`, `/login`, and
agent auth storage still own interactive model switching and login state.
When `[agent]` is omitted, memcode falls back to `[memory.llm]` defaults without
changing its interactive model commands.

### `[memory.llm]`

Used by Memorix background memory intelligence:

- memory formation
- summarization
- deduplication
- optional LLM reranking fallback
- cleanup assistance

Common keys:

- `provider`
- `model`
- `base_url`
- `api_key`

For OpenAI-compatible providers such as DashScope, DeepSeek-compatible gateways,
or internal model gateways, use `provider = "openai"` and set `base_url`.

### `[embedding]`

Used by semantic/vector search. This lane is intentionally separate from
`[agent]` and `[memory.llm]`.

Common keys:

- `provider`
- `model`
- `base_url`
- `api_key`
- `dimensions`

Provider values:

- `off`
- `api`
- `auto`
- `fastembed`
- `transformers`

If embedding is unavailable, Memorix falls back to BM25/full-text search.
`transformers` is no longer installed by default; install
`@huggingface/transformers` explicitly in the project or global prefix where
Memorix runs if you choose that provider. `fastembed` remains a supported local
provider and is likewise not installed by default.

OpenRouter embeddings can use the official OpenRouter environment variable:

```toml
[embedding]
provider = "api"
model = "qwen/qwen3-embedding-8b"
base_url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
```

Then set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in your shell, user environment, or `.env`. You
can still set `MEMORIX_EMBEDDING_API_KEY` when you want an explicit embedding
key override; it takes priority over `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.

When `base_url` points at OpenRouter and no `model` is configured, Memorix
defaults to `qwen/qwen3-embedding-8b` (4096 dimensions) instead of the
OpenAI-only default. The equivalent env-var form is
`MEMORIX_EMBEDDING=api`, `MEMORIX_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`,
`MEMORIX_EMBEDDING_MODEL=qwen/qwen3-embedding-8b`.

### `[rerank]`

Remote neural rerank. HTTP only — Memorix never loads a local cross-encoder
and never calls `api.jina.ai`. The client posts the same Cohere-compatible
body Hindsight uses (`{model, query, documents}`) to OmniRoute
`POST /v1/rerank`. OmniRoute is the hop that talks to Jina.

Common keys:

- `provider` — `off` (default) or `http` (`jina` is accepted as an alias for `http`)
- `model` — default `jina-reranker-v3`
- `base_url` — OmniRoute OpenAI-compatible root, for example
  `https://omniroute.jaguar-fish.ts.net/v1`. In-cluster:
  `http://omniroute.omniroute.svc.cluster.local/v1`. When unset and
  `provider = "http"`, Memorix inherits `[memory.llm].base_url`.
- `api_key` — OmniRoute bearer. When unset, inherits the memory LLM key
  (`MEMORIX_LLM_API_KEY`, `MEMORIX_API_KEY`, or `[memory.llm].api_key`).
  Do not put a Jina key here.

A Jina hostname in `base_url` disables the lane.

Environment overrides (highest priority after CLI flags):

```bash
MEMORIX_RERANK_PROVIDER=http
MEMORIX_RERANK_MODEL=jina-reranker-v3
MEMORIX_RERANK_BASE_URL=https://omniroute.jaguar-fish.ts.net/v1
# MEMORIX_RERANK_API_KEY=   # optional; inherits the OmniRoute LLM bearer
```

On a second machine that already talks to OmniRoute for `[memory.llm]`,
add only:

```toml
[rerank]
provider = "http"
model = "jina-reranker-v3"
```

or set `MEMORIX_RERANK_PROVIDER=http`. Timeout is still
`MEMORIX_RERANK_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 5000). Neural rerank runs first on
the existing thorough/heavy/ambiguous search gate; LLM rerank is the
fallback.

Image analysis (visual description for ingested images) runs on the LLM lane
through an OpenAI-compatible vision endpoint, so it can also use OpenRouter
with a multimodal model — for example `qwen/qwen3-vl-8b-instruct` via
`MEMORIX_LLM_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` and
`MEMORIX_LLM_MODEL=qwen/qwen3-vl-8b-instruct`.

### Controlled MiniMax media

MiniMax generation is separate from the text embedding lane. Set one of these
outside Git only when you deliberately use image or video generation:

- `MINIMAX_API_KEY` for the global endpoint
- `MINIMAX_CN_API_KEY` for the China endpoint
- optional `MINIMAX_REGION=global|cn`
- optional image/video model and endpoint overrides for self-managed routing

The CLI is the normal generation path. `memorix_media` can import, attach, and
inspect assets through MCP, but MCP generation is off by default. Set
`MEMORIX_MCP_MEDIA_GENERATION=1` only after you intentionally allow an agent to
create provider-billed output. The default OpenRouter text embedder remains
text-only; Memorix produces a media vector only when a provider explicitly
declares compatibility with that media modality.

Controlled assets default to a 100 MiB import limit. Vision analysis has a
separate 20 MiB cap so a large local file can remain a usable asset without
creating an oversized chat-completions request.

### Controlled audio transcription

Audio-to-text is a separate, opt-in derivative lane. Set the matching provider
credential outside Git:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` with `MEMORIX_TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER=openai`
- `GROQ_API_KEY` with `MEMORIX_TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER=groq`
- optional `MEMORIX_TRANSCRIPTION_MODEL=<provider model>`

The conservative source limit is 25 MiB. The CLI is enabled when a credential
is present; MCP-originated transcription remains disabled unless
`MEMORIX_MCP_MEDIA_TRANSCRIPTION=1` is set after reviewing provider billing.

### Controlled PDF text derivation

PDF text extraction is a separate, opt-in derivative lane with no provider
credentials. `memorix media derive-pdf --asset <asset-id>` parses the managed
PDF locally (bundled PDF.js via `unpdf`, system fonts disabled) and stores a
bounded text derivative with page and character limits (`--maxPages`,
`--maxChars`). The MCP `memorix_media` tool accepts `derive-pdf` with the same
bounds, and the derived text only enters normal memory when explicitly
attached.

### `[memory]`

Runtime memory behavior.

Common keys:

- `inject = "minimal"` (`full`, `minimal`, `silent`)
- `formation = "active"` (`active`, `shadow`, `fallback`)
- `auto_cleanup = true`
- `sync_advisory = true`

The same values are available in legacy YAML under `behavior.*`. Existing
`~/.memorix/config.json` behavior settings are retained only as a fallback for
older installs.

### `[git]`

Git-memory and hook behavior.

Common keys:

- `auto_hook = false`
- `ingest_on_commit = true`
- `max_diff_size = 500`
- `skip_merge_commits = true`
- `exclude_patterns = ["*.lock", "dist/**"]`
- `noise_keywords = ["format", "typo"]` (literal phrases, case-insensitive)

Project identity is still resolved from the real `.git` root. A project
`memorix.toml` is an override file under that root; it does not create or rename
the Memorix project ID.

### `[codegraph]`

Code State, CodeGraph Memory, and Project Context scan/provider settings.

Common keys:

- `exclude_patterns = ["vendor/**", "third_party/**", "generated/**"]`
- `max_file_bytes = 2097152` (2 MiB per source file by default)
- `external_context = "auto"` (`"off"` keeps the built-in Lite provider only)
- `external_command = "C:\\tools\\codegraph.cmd"` (optional path when CodeGraph is not on `PATH`)
- `external_timeout_ms = 1200` (bounded local semantic-query timeout)

Legacy YAML uses `codegraph.excludePatterns`, `codegraph.maxFileBytes`,
`codegraph.externalContext`, `codegraph.externalCommand`, and
`codegraph.externalTimeoutMs` for the same settings.

These patterns extend Memorix's built-in CodeGraph excludes (`node_modules`,
build outputs, worktrees, and similar generated directories). Matching paths are
skipped during CodeGraph indexing and hidden from Project Context / Context Pack
suggested reads. Files larger than `max_file_bytes` are also skipped so a
generated or minified source file cannot monopolize an incremental scan. Raise
the limit only for a repository where that file is intentional source.

`external_context = "auto"` is deliberately conservative. Memorix checks for
an already-initialized local `.codegraph` index and uses it only when its status
matches the current project and has no pending changes. It never runs
`codegraph init`, `index`, or `sync`, and it never sends repository content to
a remote service. A valid external response contributes only a small semantic
outline to the current task Workset; raw code is neither copied into the
Workset nor persisted as Memorix knowledge. See
[1.2 Provider Quality](1.2.0-PROVIDER-QUALITY.md) for the complete contract.

### `[server]`

Server and dashboard behavior.

Common keys:

- `transport = "stdio"` — advisory. An explicit `memorix serve-http` still
  runs on HTTP and prints a notice; this key documents the intended mode.
- `port = 3211` — default listener port for `memorix serve-http` when
  `--port` is not given.
- `dashboard = true`
- `dashboard_port = 3210` — default port for `memorix dashboard` when
  `--port` is not given.

### Reserved sections (parsed, not yet enforced)

These sections exist so future releases do not need a config format change.
Today no runtime behavior reads them; set them only as forward-looking notes.

- `[team]` (`enabled`, `workspace_collection`) — coordination defaults.
- `[hooks]` (`native_memcode`, `external_agents`) — hook bootstrap policy.
- The former `mcpServers` key in `memorix.yml` was removed: no code ever
  consumed it, and Memorix is not an MCP aggregator. Unknown keys are
  ignored, so old files keep loading.

---

## Compatibility

These files are still read when TOML is absent or incomplete:

- legacy project `memorix.yml`
- legacy user `~/.memorix/memorix.yml`
- project `.env`
- user `~/.memorix/.env`
- legacy `~/.memorix/config.json`

New commands should create TOML. Existing users do not need to migrate
immediately.

Useful commands:

```bash
memorix config path
memorix config get agent.model
memorix status
```

To create one global file from existing local settings:

```bash
memorix config migrate --global
```

To create a project override file without writing local credentials:

```bash
memorix config migrate
```

`memorix status` shows the active project, search mode, and resolved
configuration lanes with sensitive values redacted.
